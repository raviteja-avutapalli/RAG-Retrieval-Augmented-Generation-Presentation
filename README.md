# RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Presentation
This project explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) â€” a powerful technique that enhances the factual accuracy and relevance of language models by combining document retrieval with generative AI.

Developed as part of a graduate-level course on scalable learning systems, this research dives deep into the architecture, algorithms, and real-world applications of RAG. It shows how RAG overcomes the limitations of static large language models by integrating dynamic, query-based retrieval into the generation process.

Key Highlights:
Core Components: Retriever (Dense Passage Retrieval), Generator (BART/T5), and an external knowledge base.

Algorithms Covered: Dense retrieval using BERT-based encoders, sparse retrieval with BM25, and sequence-to-sequence generation.

Training Strategy: Joint optimization via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) using open-domain QA datasets such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Applications: Effective in domains like healthcare, legal tech, finance, customer support, and education.

Performance Gains: Demonstrates ~20% improvement in factual accuracy and significantly lowers hallucination rates compared to traditional LLMs.

Forward-Looking Enhancements: Incorporation of knowledge graphs, faster indexing methods, multimodal retrieval, and live web search integration.

This repository is intended for researchers, students, and AI practitioners looking to implement or better understand RAG in real-world applications. The project highlights both the promise and the practical limitations of RAG, and proposes improvements for scalable, trustworthy AI systems.
