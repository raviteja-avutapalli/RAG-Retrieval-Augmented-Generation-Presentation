# 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks

This repository explores **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — an advanced architecture that enhances the factual consistency and contextual accuracy of generative language models by integrating external document retrieval into the generation workflow.

Developed as part of the **CSE6392: Advanced Topics in Scalable Learning** course under the mentorship of **Dr. Junzhou Huang**, this project provides a comprehensive breakdown of RAG's architecture, algorithms, training methodology, applications, and future improvements.

## 📌 Key Highlights

### ✅ Core Components
- **Retriever**: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) engine that fetches relevant content from external corpora.
- **Generator**: Transformer-based model (e.g., BART or T5) to synthesize coherent, factually accurate responses.
- **Knowledge Base**: Collection of external sources like Wikipedia, ArXiv, PubMed, and internal documents.

### 📚 Algorithm Deep-Dive
- **Dense Retrieval**: Semantic search using BERT-based DPR.
- **Sparse Retrieval**: BM25-based keyword search.
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines DPR + BM25 for improved coverage.
- **Generative Model**: Sequence-to-sequence transformers for context-aware text generation.

### ⚙️ Training Paradigm
- **MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation)** for joint optimization of retriever and generator.
- Trained on QA datasets like **Natural Questions (NQ)** and **TriviaQA**.

### 💡 Real-World Use Cases
- **Healthcare**: Summarizing research papers and aiding medical decision-making.
- **Legal Tech**: Retrieving and generating legal case precedents.
- **Finance**: Providing real-time stock insights.
- **Customer Support**: Enhancing chatbots with updated product FAQs.
- **Cybersecurity**: Threat intelligence summarization.
- **Education**: Personalized content delivery from academic corpora.

### 📊 Performance Metrics
- **+20% Factual Accuracy** over traditional LLMs.
- **Lower Hallucination Rate** due to retrieval-grounded generation.
- **High Retrieval Precision** with improved semantic matching.

### 🧠 Future Directions
- Integration with **Knowledge Graphs**
- Support for **Multimodal RAG** (Text + Images + Video)
- **Live Web Search** for dynamic updates
- User Feedback-Driven Retrieval Enhancement
